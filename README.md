#PO-20 Chord Helper

Use this tool to explore a custom chord network from the [PO-20](https://teenage.engineering/guides/po-20/en), with visual guides.

**PO-20 not required!**

##Quickstart
1. Run pochords.py
2. Choose a key in the **Key** Groupbox
3. Click a visible chord from the **Chord Guide** area you want to inspect in the **Visualization** area. 
4. Repeat this process with different progressions, and play your Piano/Keyboard or your PO-20 on the side to learn how they move and sound!

###View Options
* Use the **View** -> **Toggle Background** to view as if the Pocket Operator is behind
* Use the **View** -> **Show All** option to view all chords at once. 

Live demo coming soon (On a touchscreen with a rig)

You get an animated gif for now. Enjoy!

I don't know why Teenage Engineering chose these chord combinations, but I imagine it would have something to do with a high qty of variety and modulation capability. 
So for this reason alone, I think this chord network is worth exploring more! Especially if you're learning to solo and want a guide.

##TODO
* Midi out integration

* Eventually create a cheap chord generator that can run on a Pi and use MIDI.
